                was active around 2013. before we stated this one, we tried to contact the person through mail, twitter, github and linked-in but to no avail, so we went on and created this one

            <h1>the need for a python user-group</h1>
            <p>
                better coordinate python activities. <br>

                general discussions serve it's purpose, so does topic specialisation.
