# pymug
website source of pymug.com - python mauritius user group

# website
https://abdur-rahmaanj.github.io/pymug/ or http://www.pymug.com

# structure
the site's structure is dictated by github pages' specifications and handling rather than good standards.

an index.html in every folder, path or lib, is a brillant idea of github (really)

# quick start

no need to install jinja, just activate the virtual env
